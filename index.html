Junior Frontend Developer - Are you looking for the best training in the business?</p>

<p>This vacancy is simple. If you are a Junior Frontend Developer and want to have the best training in the business, you should apply via <a href="mailto:nick@thefrontendlab.com">nick@thefrontendlab.com</a></p>

<p>This company want people like a sponge. Willingness to learn. The directors and managers love people who have a passion and desire to learn. You will be provided with the best possible training and development out there. The mentality is they want people they can train &amp; develop. So enthusiasm, energy is critical to show. Especially at this level when you are a junior looking to get your first job or first real development opportunity.</p>

<p>Our client is the most awarded agency in the Netherlands. You should also take note that the majority of their FWA awards have been awarded in the last year or so. So this is an agency really pushing forward, really in the news and delivering high quality work.</p>

<p>I know it is a cliché but this is 100% not a 9 to 5 job. They want people who want to build super awesome stuff. If that’s what you want this is the place to be for sure! Because of the deadlines there will be long hours involved and they want people, who after a touch day at work, go home and build something for themselves!!! ;). The directors are being interviewed by hundreds of people. Don't miss these guys at the SxSW Festival!</p>

<p>Company</p>

<p>There is an awesome relationship between creative and technology. This is one of the biggest selling points as there is huge respect between the creative team and tech team. Everything is discussed openly throughout projects to deliver the most outstanding experiences for clients as possible.</p>

<p>The amount of awards (and maybe more importantly how recently they are happening) shows the quality of work you will be delivering. It will also allow you to be proud the work you deliver will be seen by millions and recognized by the global awarding associations</p>

<p>There is no better company to develop. Here you will have the best training. Apply now via <a href="mailto:nick@thefrontendlab.com">nick@thefrontendlab.com</a></p>
